# Grow Admin

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/56169dc1-d183-4676-be85-37caf800c911/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/thriving-kulfi-6971fb/deploys)

So someone on the channel asked me to do an admin dashboard with Vuetify. I thought it was a good idea, so here it is.

This is a simple admin dashboard with login and dashboard page. It uses [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/). One day in the future, I plan to create a project with one of the official modules listed on the [NuxtJS website](https://nuxt.com/modules/).
